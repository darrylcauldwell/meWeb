          Plan your week. Cook with confidence. Track nutrition on your own terms. Everything syncs across your household via iCloud — but your personal data stays personal.
        </p>

        <h2>Plan Together</h2>
        <p>
          Drag recipes onto a visual week planner. Smart suggestions learn your household's favourites and gently surface new ideas. Copy last week's plan or start fresh.
        </p>

        <h2>Recipes — Three Ways In</h2>
        <p>
          Build recipes by hand. Import from any recipe website. Or describe what you have and let AI generate a recipe — choose your cuisine, cooking style, time, and dietary needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Cook Step by Step</h2>
        <p>
          Full-screen Cooking Mode with large text, a built-in timer, and an ingredient checklist. Designed for messy hands and busy kitchens.
        </p>

        <div class="not-prose flex justify-center my-8">
          <img src="/images/apps/tabletogether-plan-iphone.png" alt="TableTogether meal plan view on iPhone" class="max-w-xs rounded-2xl shadow-lg" loading="lazy" />
        </div>

        <h2>Shop Smarter</h2>
        <p>
          Mark what's already in your pantry. Everything else flows into a shopping list organised by aisle — ready when you are.
        </p>

        <h2>Describe What You Ate</h2>
        <p>
          Type a meal in plain language. On-device AI parses the ingredients, then resolves nutrition from USDA FoodData Central and Open Food Facts. See exactly how each estimate was calculated. Tap any ingredient to refine the match.
        </p>

        <h2>Private Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Your meal logs, targets, and trends are personal — never shared with your household. Weekly patterns shown without judgment. No streaks. No scores. Just information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optionally connect Apple Health to sync body metrics and log dietary macros automatically.
        </p>

        <h2>Works Everywhere</h2>
        <p>
          iPhone, iPad, and Mac for planning, cooking, and logging. Apple TV as a calm ambient display showing today's meals — like a kitchen whiteboard in the living room.
        </p>
