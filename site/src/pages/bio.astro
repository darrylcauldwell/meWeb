        I started my career in 1994 soldering circuit boards and swapping components on NCR towers and analogue mobile phones at Royal Mail. I built my first database in Microsoft Access to track serial numbers and device movements. Thirty years later, I'm still solving the same fundamental problem — how do you get complex systems to work reliably at scale — just with considerably fewer soldering irons.
      </p>

      <h2>The Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Those early years at Royal Mail took me from electronics repair through desktop support, nationwide deployments, and into the internet era — where I helped run the public-facing infrastructure for royalmail.com. Along the way I picked up a British Computer Society Medal and caught the Agile bug before most people had heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent eleven years at CSC, where I progressed from platform engineer to architect across healthcare, government, and defence. The work ranged from deploying nationally sensitive IT infrastructure at the UK Border Agency in Belgrade to building what was then Veritas's largest worldwide deployment of Cluster Services and Citrix's largest global solution. I led a team of 114 engineers in Chennai, designed multi-petabyte storage solutions with 99.99% availability, and started automating everything I could get my hands on — first with Altiris scripts, then Puppet, then Ansible. That automation work earned a CSC Global Award for Technical Excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Atos, I transitioned engineering teams from monolithic releases to iterative DevOps delivery, introduced Ansible as the standard across Global Cloud Engineering, and architected an AWS managed cloud offering. I then moved to DXC Technology where I led the design of standardised private cloud platforms with self-service catalogues for defence, government, financial, and healthcare customers. This was my first proper product management role, introducing me to Scaled Agile and stakeholder management at enterprise scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2019, I've been at VMware as a Customer Success Architect, helping customers design and deliver highly automated, secure, and resilient multi-cloud architectures spanning VCF, NSX, Tanzu, and Aria across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. I also serve as an Office of the CTO Ambassador, working at the intersection of edge computing, IT/OT convergence, and sustainability — connecting customers with R&D teams and turning emerging technology into real-world solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>
        A recurring theme throughout my career has been designing solutions, proving them in production, and then scaling or replicating them across regions and organisations. I've done this with VMware platforms, cloud infrastructure, automation frameworks, and managed service offerings. The technology changes, but the pattern stays the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a committed advocate for sustainability in technology. As a VMware Sustainability Ambassador and active member of the UN Global Compact's UK network, I work on carbon footprint measurement, power-aware workload placement, and helping organisations understand the environmental impact of their infrastructure decisions. This isn't a side interest — it's woven into the architectural guidance I provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've held 50+ industry certifications, been recognised as a VMware vExpert for 11 consecutive years, and collected 12 awards along the way — from a NetApp EMEA Innovation Award to multiple VMware and CSC global recognitions. I write about what I learn on this <a href="/post">blog</a>, which has been running since 2013.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      <p>
        My family and I share a love of travel, particularly in Africa — my wife and I got married in Zanzibar. When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me walking the moors with our two Springer Spaniels or acting as groom and driver for my daughter's Irish Sports Horse, who competes at British Showjumping. In 2014, I volunteered with Team4Tech in Tanzania, developing a digital literacy teacher training programme for rural schools. I once spent a few months travelling independently through Peru and Bolivia, which remains one of the best decisions I've made.
