        <p class="text-[var(--color-text)] text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Enterprise architect with <strong>30+ years</strong> progressing from hands-on engineering through automation, DevOps, and product management to delivering cloud infrastructure solutions across
          <strong>VMware</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and <strong>public cloud</strong> platforms.
          A recurring theme throughout my career has been designing solutions, proving them in production, and then scaling or replicating them across regions and organisations.
          I provide architectural guidance for customers developing highly automated, secure, available, resilient, and multi-cloud architectural designs.
          The designs typically need to seamlessly integrate with very complex estates which requires focussed problem-solving and analytical skills.
          Recognised with <strong>12 industry awards</strong> for technical excellence and innovation.
          Passionate about sustainability, community contribution, and enabling customer success.

                    <p>Designed and automated private cloud infrastructure using hyper-converged VMware SDDC. Showcased how automation enables rapid, consistent provisioning - reducing time to production and freeing teams from manual infrastructure work. This was essentially building a VMware SDDC stack - the pattern that later became VCF - but before VCF existed. Ansible automation handled the full SDDC provisioning - we wrote and published Ansible modules for ESXi host and vSAN management in vCenter. The arrival of VMware NSX for vSphere significantly changed the SDN automation landscape, requiring rework of the network provisioning layer. Jenkins CI pipelines provided the consumption layer for self-service delivery of servers, applications, SDN, distributed firewall, and NFV.</p>

Developed stateless application deployment using VHD detachment/attachment with PowerShell, NetApp snapshots, and VMware.

                    <p>Hardware technology refresh - led rearchitecting the VMware hosting solution for more robust scale and DR capability. Innovative NetApp partnership enabled transglobal data replication. Complemented by decomposing a monolithic application into smaller, independently shippable delivery units. Central to this was migrating storage to NetApp across the UK and Chennai sites, with SnapMirror replication enabling transglobal data mobility. NetApp snapshots provided disaster recovery capability and enabled reporting data to be split from OLTP databases - removing analytical workloads from production. The database tier ran on massive HPE Itanium SuperDome IA64 systems, making certification and validation particularly complex. Upgraded through vSphere 4.x to 5.0, implementing HA and DRS clustering for availability and load balancing. VMware SRM automated DR failover between sites. NetApp ONTAP configuration included deduplication, thin provisioning, and FlexClone for dev/test copies. VMware Update Manager handled ESXi patching at scale. Performance baselining validated the redesign with before/after metrics, and capacity planning drove consolidation ratios and VM right-sizing. N+1 resilience design ensured host and chassis failures wouldn't impact patient-facing systems. Application dependency mapping, change management for zero-downtime migration of production healthcare workloads, and vendor coordination across NetApp, HPE, and VMware.</p>

The governance and control this introduced simplified deployment at scale and made day-two operations manageable. The platform became Veritas's largest worldwide deployment of Veritas Cluster Services (VCS) - a unique disaster recovery solution for both databases and VMs - and the largest Citrix solution globally at the time. Pre-API era, automation relied on scripting with VBScript, batch files, and WMI for remote Windows configuration. Bare-metal blade provisioning used HP Rapid Deployment Pack integrated with Altiris for PXE boot and scripted OS installs across HP BladeSystem c-Class infrastructure. SAN provisioning included LUN masking, zoning, and fibre channel configuration. Early adoption of VMware ESX 2 with MUI management interface marked the start of virtualisation in the environment. Automated creation of cookie-cutter training environments by scripting VMX files and cloning VMDK files to produce isolated instances of iSoft clinical applications. Each environment ran dual-homed Windows servers with self-contained Active Directory and supporting services on overlapping address spaces - enabling train-the-trainer programmes that scaled hospital staff onboarding. These isolated, repeatable environments were a game changer for the programme.</p>

                    <p>Operating Royal Mail's public-facing internet infrastructure - business-critical IIS, DNS, and Squid proxy services. Internet services were a rapidly growing area of business value for Royal Mail, and this role was a natural progression into that space. Managed public-facing infrastructure for royalmail.com, Parcelforce, and group brands - massive scale for the time. Security included DMZ architecture with CheckPoint Firewall-1 and SSL. My work here led to joining the 'Change of Address' team, among the first in the UK to embrace Agile. Learned middleware technologies including IBM WebSphere MQ, WebSphere, and SAP ERP. The .NET web service was the Change of Address application - a broker that processed address change requests and propagated updates across multiple government record systems. The Agile approach included Scrum practices and peer programming, predating the widespread adoption of terms like XP.</p>

                    <p>Moved from deploying applications in the field to validating them in the lab. Tested end-to-end server and network solutions, working with R&D on pre-production Compaq hardware. Having seen deployment challenges firsthand, I could now identify issues before they reached scale - and started influencing developers to design for day-two operations. Key activities included load and stress testing with LoadRunner to simulate production-scale traffic, compatibility testing against the existing estate, network infrastructure and WAN testing between sites, disaster recovery and failover validation, and capacity planning to size hardware for production workloads. Wrote test plans and acceptance criteria as release gates, with defect tracking back to development teams. Evaluated Windows 2000 and Active Directory migration paths from NT 4.0.</p>
