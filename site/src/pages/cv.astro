                  <p>In my role as the leader of the design and engineering team, I was tasked with developing a standardised Infrastructure as a Service private cloud offering that boasted a comprehensive self-service Platform as a Service (PaaS) catalogue.</p>
                  <p>The PaaS service catalogue offered self-service delivery of servers, database engines, middleware, security services, backup, disaster recovery, firewall, and network function virtualisation.</p>
                  <p>The resulting solution proved to be a success, with customers across industries such as defence, government secure, financial, and healthcare adopting it. The self-service portal-driven automation and orchestration workflows encompassed provisioning, guest customisation, day two lifecycle management, and billing.</p>

                  <p>As the technical design and engineering lead for the global Managed Mid-range offering, I spearheaded the development of a highly standardised hosting platform that enabled streamlined day two operational support. Unlike the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering, this solution offered a more personalised approach to workload deployment, with greater flexibility for customisation.</p>

                  <p>In my role as technical lead, I led an initiative to streamline the delivery of a VMware-based virtual hosting platform by industrialising the process. To achieve this, I created a modular technical design and configuration that could be consistently built by technology partners such as Dell, Hitachi, and HPE in their build factories.</p>
                  <p>I also established a delivery workflow process that integrated with all data centre systems, from factory delivery through all the on-site systems integrations.</p>
                  <p>The benefits of industrialising the delivery of the VMware virtual hosting platform were significant for the business, including enhanced sales capabilities, accurate pricing of deals, consistent global delivery, and reduced delivery timelines.</p>

                  <span class="role-date">December 2015 - December 2016</span>
                  <p>While working in Global Cloud Engineering, I played a crucial role in transitioning product engineering from a monolithic approach to an iterative method. I introduced Ansible automation extensively to enable the delivery of infrastructure configuration as per the desired state.</p>
                  <p>This standardisation of infrastructure configuration, coupled with measuring the desired state, helped the day two operations team achieve economies of scale, resulting in fewer incidents and better customer satisfaction. Moreover, adopting an iterative delivery approach enabled us to introduce new technology features into the product faster, while making smaller changes helped improve the change risk profile.</p>

                  <p>As a team member, I participated in the architecture, engineering, automation, and delivery of a Managed Public Cloud (MPC) offering based on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This MPC service offered centralised management, billing, monitoring, and security solutions that were securely accessible to customers via ServiceNow.</p>
                  <p>My responsibilities included designing the architecture and creating a set of complex CloudFormation templates to deploy standard configurations across AWS accounts. In cases where CloudFormation was insufficient, I created custom "glue" automation using a combination of Ansible and Lambda, with configuration stored in DynamoDB.</p>

                  <p>As the technical lead for design, engineering, and delivery, I oversaw a complex NSX for vSphere solution. This solution provided a site-resilient, centralised control hub for thirty-one remote sites or "spokes." To join all the spokes to the hub, we used NSX Edge Services Gateway Site-to-Site VPN tunnels and ensured traffic security using micro-segmentation firewall rules.</p>

                  <p>As part of a team, I helped design, build, and automate a dedicated private cloud infrastructure using hyper-converged technology for VMware's SDDC. This cloud offering was made available for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) through the Service Mesh Agility Platform.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, I developed a capability demonstration which showcased the consumption of IaaS using a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline based on Jenkins.

                  <p>As a systems engineer and leader within a DevOps team, I oversaw the transformation of our development workflow from a static release process to a continuous delivery approach. This was achieved through the use of Service Mesh Agility Platform to orchestrate the provisioning of virtual servers and the handoff to Puppet for applying the desired configuration state all the way to running the application.</p>
                  <p>By adopting declarative infrastructure as code (IaC), we were able to improve the availability of our applications while also reducing operational support costs. The implementation of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline brought numerous benefits across the development and production lifecycle, fostering closer collaboration between IT Operations, testing, and Development teams.</p>

                  <p>In my capacity as a project lead, I oversaw the design, engineering, and delivery of a VMware-based virtual hosting solution, which was utilised by several hundred developers and testers.

                  <p>As the lead for design, engineering, and delivery, I oversaw the development and implementation of a VMware-based hosting solution, which enabled developers and testers to deliver virtual servers using the same Altiris modular automation packages that were used in production environments.</p>

                  <p>The solution involved the creation of reusable, modular scripting assets that were stored in Altiris, with unique server identities delivered by passing variables to the scripts and orchestrating the correct components in the correct order.</p>
                  <p>This deployment was Veritas's largest worldwide deployment of VCS for Windows and VCS for VMware at the time.</p>

          <p>My family and I share a passion for travel, particularly in Africa where we have had some memorable experiences. In fact, my wife and I even got married in Zanzibar, Tanzania. I also have a keen interest in the countryside and often spend my free time walking the moors with our Sprocker Spaniel and acting as groom and driver for my daughter's Fell pony.</p>
